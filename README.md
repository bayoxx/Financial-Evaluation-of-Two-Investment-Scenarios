### **Project Report: Financial Evaluation of Two Investment Scenarios**

---

#### **1. Introduction**
This report evaluates two investment scenarios for a startup's project to determine the most financially viable option. The company produces gadgets for smart homes.

Scenario 1 investment opportunity is to build an extension of a factory building and increase manufacturing activities. 

Scenario 2 investment opportunity is to build a digital product and invest in marketing.


Scenario 1 involves significant upfront investments in fixed assets (equipment and buildings), while Scenario 2 opts for an alternative strategy with no investments in fixed assets (equipment and buildings). Key financial metrics were analyzed, including Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Payback Period, Profitability Index, and Return on Investment (ROI). Opportunity costs were also calculated to assess the trade-offs between the two scenarios.

#### Assumptions for the First Scenario

- **Project**: Build a factory, including buildings and machine tools required for production.  
- **Increase in Sales**: After the implementation of the project, sales volumes are expected to increase by **50%** from the current levels, with a further annual increase of **10%**.  
- **Cost**: An additional **10 people** with the company's average salary will be required to service the new production capacity.  
- **Costs**: Marketing budgets will need to be adjusted further to sustain the projected sales growth.  
- **Duration of the Project**: **2 years**.  

---

#### Assumptions for the Second Scenario

- **Project**: Conduct active marketing activities and develop a digital product.  
- **Increase in Sales**: Sales are expected to grow by **30%** annually during the campaign. Growth is anticipated to decrease to **15%** in subsequent periods.  
- **Cost**: Hiring **10 people** with **2x the company's average salary**, starting in the first year, to support service provision and development.  
- **Costs**: After the campaign ends, advertising budgets are projected to drop to **€1 million per year**.  
- **Duration of the Project**: **2 years**.

#### Investment Allocation  

The company plans to allocate **€5.4 million** to the first scenario and **€8 million** to the second scenario. Investment funds will be sourced from **internal funds**, **credit institutions**, and **private investors**.  

The projected costs of the projects and the investment breakdown are summarized in the table below.

- **Scenario 1:**
  - Investments in fixed assets (equipment and buildings) and service purchases.
  - Total project value: €5,418,273.20 (2018: €1,042,309.28; 2019: €4,375,963.92).
 

- **Scenario 2:**
  - No investment in equipment or buildings, relying solely on service purchases.
  - Total project value: €8,000,000 (2018: €4,000,000; 2019: €4,000,000).

#### **3. Key Metrics and Calculations**
##### **3.1 Total Cash flows**
- Scenario 1: €13,687,709.40
- Scenario 2: -€10,297,701.06.
  
Scenario 1 outperforms Scenario 2.

---

##### **3.2 Payback Period**
The payback period measures the time required to recover the initial investment.
- Scenario 1: **2 years**.
- Scenario 2: **>5 years**.
  
Scenario 1 offers a faster recovery of the initial investment.

---

##### **3.3 Net Present Value (NPV)**
NPV represents the present value of cash inflows minus initial investment, calculated at a 4% discount rate.
- Scenario 1: **€6,505,427.54**.
- Scenario 2: **-€15,426,254.35**.
  
Scenario 1 generates a substantially higher NPV, indicating greater profitability.

---

##### **3.4 Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**
IRR is the discount rate at which NPV equals zero.
- Scenario 1: **47.17%%**.
- Scenario 2: **-57.94%%**.
  
Scenario 1 provides a significantly higher IRR, demonstrating superior investment efficiency.

---

##### **3.5 Profitability Index**
The Profitability Index (PI) measures the value generated per euro invested.
- Scenario 1: **0.20**.
- Scenario 2: **-2.93**.
  
Scenario 1 delivers greater value for every euro invested.

---

##### **3.6 Return on Investment (ROI)**
ROI evaluates the total return as a percentage of the initial investment.
- Scenario 1: **71.10%%**.
- Scenario 2: **-228.72%%**.
  
Scenario 1 offers a substantially higher ROI.

---

##### **3.7 Opportunity Cost**
The opportunity cost quantifies the potential NPV foregone by selecting Scenario 2 over Scenario 1.
- **Opportunity Cost (NPV): 6,505,427.54**.

By choosing Scenario 2, the company sacrifices the potential profitability of €2,618,619.79, as indicated by the NPV difference.
